This is the rope maze puzzle solved using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

I recently visited a Science museum where they provided this maze with a rope.  

Here is how it works.
 
  Starting in the NE room of the maze, go through every single door without the rope crossing.
  
It claimed that it had never been solved, which drove me nuts.  So I wrote a program to figure it
out for me.
